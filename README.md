# customer_banking
Challenge 3
This is a banking interfact created using Python.

This program imports functions from 3 files(Account.py, customer_banking.py and cd_accounts.py).  They are controlled by a user input file (customer_banking.py)

It uses OOP.  Accont is the Class.  Instances are savings_account and cd_account in their respective files.

customer_banking controls all of the user input included in both accounts:
    Savings Balance
    Savings Interest Rate
    Months
    Which print/returns the new balance and interest earned.
    CD Balance
    CD Interest Rate
    Months to Maturity
    Which print/returns the new balance and interest earned.

The Challenge Rubric did not reuqire anything on the user side to change if input was a number (customer_banking.py), so I didn't include that. That is a must if you were going to use this code in the real world. 

Resources:
I worked in a study group with 4 other students:  Brandon, Natalie, Tania and Jennifer to review organization struction and ask questions about using "0" as a starting value.  In addition, I looked at other repositories, used CHATGpt to explain how the files interacted and read the sections on Class in the book "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes.
